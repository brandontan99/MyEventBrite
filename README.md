# MyEventBrite
My very first mobile apps with not much focus on the UI.ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…

A Mobile Apps using Eventbrite API and Firebase API for monitoring a private event where each valid person can only have one ticket.

I found that although eventbrite allow us to organize a private event (can register through invitation link via email only), but other non-invited people can still use the same link to register a ticket too. So, I built a mobile apps to identify them by matching their registered emails and the emails I used to send (valid email) and finding out the duplicated valid emails.

All in all, my main goal is to allow a person with a valid email can register only once and no more.
